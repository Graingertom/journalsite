# fp_journaling

# LAP 1 Portfolio Week Project
You will be working in small teams to create a community journaling website.

## Requirements
#### Your website should have the following functionality for users:
- Users should be able to visit the website and anonymously post journal entries.
- Users should be limited to how many characters they can put in an entry.
- Users should be able to add gifs from [giphy](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide) in an entry.
- Users should be able to view other peoples' entries.
- Users should be able to react to other peoples’ entries with an emoji.
- Users should have three emojis to choose from.
- Users should be able to comment on other people’s entries.


#### Your project should meet the following technical requirements:
- Aim for minimum 60% test coverage (In future projects this will be enforced with an aim for 80%)
- Your repos should have excellent READMEs. See our [Writing READMEs guide](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Writing-READMEs) for details.
- Your website should be deployed (You could use eg. [Netlify](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Deploy-101) for client, [Heroku](https://github.com/getfutureproof/fp_guides_wiki/wiki/Deploying-an-Express-API-to-Heroku) for server)
- Your codebase should make good use of the technologies we have covered so far on the course: HTML, CSS & vanilla JS
- You may bring in some node libraries for specialised behaviour eg. dayjs but no large front end frameworks such as React.
- Your website should not have a database connected, instead any data sent and stored in your backend should be [saved within .json files](https://www.google.com/search?q=read+and+write+json+files+in+javascript).

## Presentation
- Prepare a 10 minute presentation covering the following topics:
    - Purpose of App
    - Planning & Delivery
    - Technologies and Code
    - Challenges and Solutions
    - Significant Code / Code you are proud of (include snippets!)
    - Test Coverage
    - Future Features & What We've Learned
    - Live Demonstration
- There will be a 5 minute opportunity for Q&A after each presentation

## Timeline
- Monday - Wednesday: Focus on functionality and features.
- Wednesday 6pm: Feature freeze.
This means that no new feature can be started. Existing features can be finished, refactored or fixed.
- Thursday: Designated for debugging, styling, extending test coverage.
- Friday: All code to be halted. Merge to master by midday and prepare for presentations. All teams will have small-group retro with an instructor during the day so make sure to manage your presentation prep time around this.
- Friday 3PM: Presentations
